# Trivia Game with Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier

A trivia game with questions, answers and scores.

this project was built with React and Typescript with the fast Vite bundler and all static code testing with Eslint and formatting with Prettier.

I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
